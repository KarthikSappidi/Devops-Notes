# Application #
- An Application, or App for short, is a software program designed to perform a specific function or set of functions. It can be used on a personal computer, mobile device or even a web browser.

# Application Architectures #
- The Three tier / Multi tier architecture is a widely used architectural pattern that divides an application into three interconnected layers.
- Frontend
- Backend [Application Tier + Database Tier]
- Database

# Frontend Tier #
- A Frontend Tier is responsible for User Interface and receiving user input.

# Application Tier #
- A Application Tier or Backend is responsible for displaying business logics.

# Database Tier #
- A Database Tier is responsible for storing data used by the application.

# Application Stacks #
- An application stack is a set of software programs that make up your Application.
- Application stack includes the softwares used for Frontend, Backend & Database.

# LMS Application [Project} #
- A Learning Management System (LMS) is a software application used for the administration, documentation, tracking, reporting, and delivery of educational courses, training programs, or learning and development programs.
- LMS also has three tier architecture.
- Like Wikipedia Uses JavaScript for Frontend -> PHP for Backend -> MariaDB for Database
- Our LMS Project Uses Reactjs for Frontend -> Nodejs for Backend -> Postgres for Database.

# LMS Application Life Cycle #
- Here is the list of Phases in an application life cycle
- Associated Tools we work with each phase
- Developers starts writing code in Laptops
- Test Application in Laptops[Sonarqube]
- Build Applications On Servers[javascript builds]
- Release Applications To Different Environments[Nexus]
- Deploy Applications On Servers[nginix,postgress,javascript]
