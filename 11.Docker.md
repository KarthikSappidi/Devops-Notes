# Docker
- Docker, so called containerisation platform, to simplify application deployment.
- **Microservices**: https://aws.amazon.com/microservices/
- **Virtualisation**: It involves creating virtual version of a hardware platform,allowing multiple operators to run on a single machine.
- **Containerisation**:is lightweight and efficient, as it allows multiple applications to run on the same operating system, without the need for a complete virtual machine. This can be especially useful for running microservices.
- **Docker**:Docker is an open-source containerization platform which helps you create containers that allows developers to easily package, deploy, and run their applications in any environment(AWS/Azure/Any Cloud/ Any Server/Laptop/CentOS/Ubuntu/etc).

# Docker Architecture
- Docker architecture consists of Docker Daemon / Docker Service & Docker Client & Docker Registry
- Docker Registry hub.docker.com registry stores Docker images(softwares postgres, node, nginx etc) and allows them to be shared
- Docker Client / Docker CLI sends commands to the daemon
- Docker Daemon is responsible for managing Docker objects such as images, containers etc
- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/docker-architecture.png

# Docker Setup
- Install Docker using following commands
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sh get-docker.sh
```
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
```

# Docker Images and Containers
- Docker Containers need images, without images we cannot run containers
- To get docker image use : docker pull 
- Containers have running modes 1: Interative Mode(Foreground) 2: Detached Mode(Background)
- To create a container in Detached Mode use command
- docker container run -dt --name  
- To create a container in Interative Mode use command
- docker container run -it --name
- command to stop running images
- sudo systemctl stop (nginx)
