# VCS - Version Control System
- Version control / Revision control / Source control is a system that helps to keep track of changes made to a file or a set of files(computer programs, web site files, documents etc) over time.

# Why VCS
- Version control gives the ability to revert a document to a previous version.
- You can think of a version control system ("VCS") as a kind of "database".
- In VCS terminology the above database called as REPOSITORY
- Repositories are used to store different types of files including code, images, documents, among others.
- LMS Repository is our project which consists of code for LMS Application.

# Centralised Version Control System
- Developers used central server to store all files and enable team collabration.
- But the major drawback of central server is its single point of failure i.e., failure of central server.

# Distributed Versin Control System
- Distributed Version Control System does not rely on central server  and thatb is why you can perform many operations when there is failure of central server.
- You can commit changes, create branches and perform other operations when you are offline.

# Git
- Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time.

# GitHub
- GitHub is a web-based platform through which users can share code, track changes, manage projects, and collaborate with others in real-time.

# Configure local computer with GitHub
- git config --global user.name <User Name>
- git config --global user.email <Email>

# Git Branches
- In a collaborative environment, it is common for several developers to share and work on the same source code. Some developers will be fixing bugs while others would be implementing new features. Therefore, there has got to be a manageable way to maintain different versions of the same code base.
- This is where the branch function comes to the rescue. Branch allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.
- Branching means you diverge from the main line(master - working copy of application) of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

# Git Merging
- The git merge lets you take the independent lines of development created by the git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
- Git merge will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history. In the most frequent use cases, git merge is used to combine two branches.

# Pull Requests
- Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.
