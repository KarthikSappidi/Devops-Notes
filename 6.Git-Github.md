# VCS - Version Control System
- Version control / Revision control / Source control is a system that helps to keep track of changes made to a file or a set of files(computer programs, web site files, documents etc) over time.

# Why VCS
- Version control gives the ability to revert a document to a previous version.
- You can think of a version control system ("VCS") as a kind of "database".
- In VCS terminology the above database called as REPOSITORY
- Repositories are used to store different types of files including code, images, documents, among others.
- LMS Repository is our project which consists of code for LMS Application.

# Centralised Version Control System
- Developers used central server to store all files and enable team collabration.
- But the major drawback of central server is its single point of failure i.e., failure of central server.

# Distributed Versin Control System
- Distributed Version Control System does not rely on central server  and thatb is why you can perform many operations when there is failure of central server.
- You can commit changes, create branches and perform other operations when you are offline.

# Git
- Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time.

# GitHub
- GitHub is a web-based platform through which users can share code, track changes, manage projects, and collaborate with others in real-time.

# Configure local computer with GitHub
- git config --global user.name <User Name>
- git config --global user.email <Email>
