# Linux #
- Linux is an open source operating system (OS). An operating system is the software that directly manages a system's hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage. The OS sits between applications and hardware and makes the connections between all of your software and the physical resources that do the work.
- The full form of LINUX is Lovable Intellect Not Using XP. Linux was built by and named after Linus Torvalds. Linux is an open-source operating system for servers, computers, mainframes, mobile systems, and embedded systems.
- Today, Linux runs many of the technologies that power up devices and services. From mobile phones, Google applications, social media networks, to GPS services, Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) products etc.
- All of the fastest 500 supercomputers in the world run on Linux.
- 97 percent of the top 1 million web servers(powers internet) run on Linux OS.
- Typically, Linux is packaged in a form known as a Linux distribution (or distro for short) for both desktop [GUI] and server [CLI] use.
- Free Server Distributions are Ubuntu, CentOS, Debian, openSUSE etc.

# Ubuntu #
- Ease of use
- Large community of users and developers.
- Modern Sopftware packages.
- Released every six months.

# Linux Architecture #
- Shell : Shell is a command line interpreter i.e, translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by Kernel.
- There are four important aspect of kernel
- which does device management, memory management,process management and handling system related calls.
- echo $SHELL
- In order to execute commands in Ubuntu, one can use the Bash shell. The Bash shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the Ubuntu operating system through a series of text commands.
- Kernel: Central module(Heart) of OS, interacts with Hardware and responsible for memory management, process management etc.
- uname -r

# Command Line Interface #
- By mastering the CLI, users can greatly enhance their productivity and streamline their workflow.
- Additionally, the CLI can be a valuable tool for automating repetitive tasks and performing complex operations that would be difficult or impossible to accomplish through graphical user interfaces (GUIs).

# Hardware Check Commands #
- CPU info: cat/proc/cpuinfo
- Ram: free -m
- HDD: df -h

# Basic Linux Commands #
- The base of the Linux file system hierarchy begins at the root (/). Directories branch off the root, but everything starts at root.
- If you hear someone say look in the slash(/) or that file is in tha slash they are reffering to Root Directory.
