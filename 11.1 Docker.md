# Docker 
- Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly. Docker packages software into standardized units called containers that have everything the software needs to run including libraries, system tools, code, and runtime.

# Container
-  Simply put, a container is another process on your machine that has been isolated from all other processes on the host machine.

# Container image
- When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. Since the image contains the container's filesystem, it must include everything needed to run the application - all dependencies, configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, and other metadata.

# Dockeer File
- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Think of it as a shell script. It gathered multiple commands into a single document to fulfill a single task.
- Command which we use to create a docker image
[ docker build -t karthiksappidi/<image-name> .]

# Docker File Copmmands
- **FROM**: specifies the base(parent) image. Alpine version is the minimal docker image based on Alpine Linux which is only 5mb in size.
- **RUN**:runs a Linux command. Used to install packages into container, create folders, etc
- **ENV**:sets environment variables. We can have multiple variables in a single dockerfile.
- **COPY**:copies files and directories to the container.
- **ENTRYPOINT**: provides command and arguments for an executing container.
- **CMD**:provides a command and arguments for an executing container. There can be only one CMD.
- **VOLUME**:create a directory mount point to access and store persistent data.
- **WORKDIR**:sets the working directory for the instructions that follow.
- **LABEL**: provides metada like maintainer.
- **ADD**: Copies files and directories to the container. Can unpack compressed files.
- **ARG**:Define build-time variable.

- # COPY vs. ADD
- **COPY**:let you copy files and directories from the host.[DOCKER RECOMMENDS TO USE COPY COMMAND]
- **ADD**: does the same. Additionally it lets you use URL location and unzip files into image.

- # ENTRYPOINT vs. CMD
- **CMD**:allows you to set a default command which will be executed only when you run a container without specifying a command. If a Docker container runs with a command, the default command will be ignored.
- **ENTRYPOINT**:allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable. ENTRYPOINT command and parameters are not ignored when Docker container runs with command line parameters.

# VOLUME
- You declare volume in your Dockerfile to denote where your container will write application data. When you run your container using -v   you can specify its mounting point.
