# Kubernetes
- Kubernetes is a Production-grade container orchestration refers to the capability of running containerized applications in a production environment.
- Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google.
- Kubernetes was originally designed by Google, and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation(CNCF).

# Kubernetes Objects
- Making use of Kubernetes requires understanding the different abstractions it uses to represent the state of the system, such as pods, services,         deployments etc.
- The above entities are k8s objects.
- These objects can be thought of as a sort of blueprint for the desired state of your application.
- By creating an object, you’re effectively telling the Kubernetes system what you want your cluster’s workload( what applications to run in the cluster) to look like, this is your cluster’s desired state.
- To work with Kubernetes **objects, whether to create, modify**, or delete them, you’ll need to use a command-line tool called **KUBECTL**.
- Every Kubernetes object includes two fields that govern the object’s configuration object spec and object status.
- The object spec, which you must provide, describes your desired state for the object(application).
- The object status describes the actual state of the object, and is supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system.
- Objects inside kubernetes can be managed by **COMMANDS** & **CODE**.
- Commands : K8S Imperative Commands.
- Code : K8S Declarative Files or K8S Manifests.

# Pod Object
- A Pod is the basic execution unit inside kubernetes or the basic building block inside kubernetes is POD.
- A Pod represents a unit of deployment, a single instance of an application in Kubernetes.
