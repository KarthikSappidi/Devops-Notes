- To host the frontend application, we need a web server
- A web server is computer software that accepts requests via HTTP (port 80) to distribute web content.
- Nginx web server is a high-performance web server that is commonly used for serving static content such as images, videos, and CSS files.
- Install Nginx Web Server
```bash
sudo apt -y install nginx
sudo ss -ntpl
```

- If you are the website administrator, You may now add webapp content to the directory DocumentRoot - /var/www/html/
- Remove sample nginx page
```bash
sudo rm -r /var/www/html/*
sudo cp -r ~/lms/webapp/dist/* /var/www/html/
```
