# SonarQube
- sonarQube is an open source platform developed by SonarSource for continuous inspection of Code Quality.
- SonarQube offers reports on duplicated code, coding standards, unit tests, bugs and security vulnerabilities.

# Forking
- FORKING in github is copying the code in my github account to your github account.
- Project Code : https://github.com/ravi2krishna/lms.git

# SonarQube Server Requirements
- Change instance type to t2.large instance which is 2 CPU & 8 GB RAM.
- Upgrade the storage to 20 GB.

# Setup SonarQube Using Docker
- Docker is a software for running containers.
- Using docker container technology we are going to run SonarQube.
- Install Docker Using following command.
```
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sh get-docker.sh
```
```
sudo ss -ntpl
```
```
sudo docker container run -dt --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
```

- Default credentials are username:admin and password:admin.
- When you stop the EC2 instance, automatically sonarqube will also stop, so start start sonarqube again use following command
```
sudo docker container start sonarqube
```
Get Application Code Using Following command

```
git clone -b dev https://github.com/KarthikSappidi/LMS.git
```
- For the above link, Make sure to change the username here from karthiksappidi to your username.
- Navigate to webapp directory where code for web application is present.
- cd /lms/webapp.
- Run the following command with your server and token details to do analysis
```
sudo docker run  --rm -e SONAR_HOST_URL="http://18.217.247.106:9000" -e SONAR_LOGIN="sqp_2a9d74469f18645443c4c72a1ea47b146340bf1a"  -v ".:/usr/src" sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli -Dsonar.projectKey=lms
