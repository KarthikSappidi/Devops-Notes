# Docker Compose
- Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.
- In simple terms,the concept of docker compose is lets we have multiple app and we want run those app in a single way,so what we can do is take a file and keep all your container coomands like a script.
- With Compose, you use a single YAML file to configure your application's services(containers).
- Using Compse is a three step process:
- Define the services(containers) that make up your app in **docker-compose.yml**.
- Define your app's environment with a Dockerfile
- Run docker compose up -d and then compose starts and runs your entire app.
```yml
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8090:5000"
  redis:
    image: "redis:alpine"
  nginx:
    image: "nginx"
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  ecomm:
    image: "ravi2krishna/webapp"
    ports:
      - "8085:80"
```
